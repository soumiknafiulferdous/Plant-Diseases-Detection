# Plant Diseases Detection

Convolutional Neural Network can be implemented by using various architectures. Selecting an appropriate architecture for a particular domain is a challenging task. Different architectures were studied and analyzed in order to choose the proper model which can meet the requirements of this research. Among many architectures of the Convolutional Neural Network, GoogleNet and VGG16 deep learning architectures were the optimum choices as they perform relatively better than other architectures. GoogleNet requires more parameters than VGGNet and hence more computational power is needed for GoogleNet. Considering the economic condition of our country where machines with large computational power are not enormously available, it was decided to use VGGNet to train the model which can identify plant diseases. Thus, the feature of requiring less computational power and providing better results of VGGNet architecture were influenced to choose this architecture.
